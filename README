What is MissingH?
-------------------------

It's a collection of Haskell-related utilities.  It is an extension of my
earlier work developing MissingLib for OCaml.  The following modules are
are provided at this time, and more are likely to follow:

IOutil                  * Copying data between files or handles
                        * Lazy operations on line input
                        * Binary I/O with Haskell strings
                        * Lazy operations on binary blocks

Listutil                * Association list manipulation
                        * List splitting and delimiter joining
                        * Truncation

Strutil                 * Leading/trailing whitespace removal
                        * Beginning/ending tests
                        * Joining, splitting, and truncation


The entire library has no prerequisites save the Haskell standard library and
findlib and is designed to install without complexity on a variety of systems.
It could also easily be embedded within your own source trees so that users
need not have it installed beforehand.

** THIS IS CURRENTLY ALPHA-QUALITY CODE; MAJOR API FLUCTUATIONS MAY YET OCCUR.

Usage in programs

You can simply use -package MissingH in most compilers to enable
this library.  

The API docs can be built with "make doc", or you can find them at:
