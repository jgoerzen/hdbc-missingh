MissingH 0.8.0 -- the "Festive Lambda" release

New feature summary:

 * Virtualized I/O system
   Use familiar functions to work on not just Handles but all sorts of
   other types, including in-memory buffers. (HVIO module)

 * Virtualized filesystem
   Extends the virtual I/O concept to the filesystem, supporting
   entire virtual filesystems, and operations such as renames,
   stat(), etc. on them.  (HVFS module)

 * Network server infrastructure
   Makes it easy to write a network server in Haskell.  Functional
   interface permits easy adding of things such as multithreading,
   logging, etc.  Functions to do these things are provided.
   Patterned loosely after Python's SocketServer system.
   (SocketServer module)

 * Full, pure-Haskell FTP server
   Provides a full FTP server over a real or virtual (HVFS)
   filesystem.  It's a SocketServer server, so you get multithreading
   for free.  Supports passive and port modes.
 
 * Many path/file manipulation functions imported from
   Volker's HsShellScript.

 * Existing MissingH.IO functions updated to be HVIO compatible.
