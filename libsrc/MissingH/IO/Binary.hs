{- | This module provides various helpful utilities for dealing with I\/O.

Important note: /binary functions are not supported in all Haskell
implementations/.  Do not import or use this module unless you know you
are using an implementation that supports them.  At this time, here
is the support status:

 * GHC 6.2: yes
 
 * GHC 6.x, earlier versions: unknown

 * GHC 5.x: no

 * nhc98: no

 * Hugs: no

Non-binary functions may be found in "MissingH.IO".

{- | As a wrapper around the standard function 'System.IO.hPutBuf',
this function takes a standard Haskell 'String' instead of the far less
convenient 'Ptr a'.  The entire contents of the string will be written
as a binary buffer using 'hPutBuf'.  The length of the output will be
the length of the string. -}

{- | As a wrapper around the standard function 'System.IO.hGetBuf',
this function returns a standard Haskell string instead of modifying
a 'Ptr a' buffer.  The length is the maximum length to read and the
semantice are the same as with 'hGetBuf'; namely, the empty string
is returned with EOF is reached, and any given read may read fewer
bytes than the given length. -}

The list simply ends at EOF. -}

{- | Binary block-based interaction.  This is useful for scenarios that
take binary blocks, manipulate them in some way, and then write them
out.  Take a look at 'hBlockCopy' for an example.  The integer argument
is the size of input binary blocks.  This function uses 'hGetBlocks'
internally.

blocks of the given size.  This is actually a beautiful implementation:

to it)

{- | Copies one filename to another in binary mode.

Please note that the Unix permission bits on the output file cannot
be set due to a limitation of the Haskell 'System.IO.openBinaryFile'
function.  Therefore, you may need to adjust those bits after the copy
yourself.
