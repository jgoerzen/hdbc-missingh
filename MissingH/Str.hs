{- | Removes any whitespace characters that are present at the start
or end of a string. Does not alter the internal contents of a
string. If no whitespace characters are present at the start or end
of a string, returns the original string unmodified. Safe to use on
any string.

Note that this may differ from some other similar
functions from other authors in that:

1. If multiple whitespace
characters are present all in a row, they are all removed;

2. If no
whitespace characters are present, nothing is done.

{- | Replaces every occurance of the given regexp with the replacement string.

In the replacement string, @\"\\1\"@ refers to the first substring; 
@\"\\2\"@ to the second, etc; and @\"\\0\"@ to the entire match.
@\"\\\\\\\\\"@ will insert a literal backslash.

This code has been integrated into the standard Haskell libraries
as Text.Regex.subRegex and is thus deprecated in MissingH.
