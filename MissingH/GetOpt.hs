{- | Simple command line parser -- a basic wrapper around the system's
default getOpt.  See the System.Console.GetOpt manual for a description of the
first two parameters.

The third parameter is a usage information header.

The return value consists of the list of parsed flags and a list of
non-option arguments. -}

{- | Similar to 'parseCmdLine', but takes an additional function that validates
the post-parse command-line arguments.  This is useful, for example, in
situations where there are two arguments that are mutually-exclusive and only
one may legitimately be given at a time.

The return value of the function indicates whether or not it detected an
error condition.  If it returns Nothing, there is no error.  If it returns
Just String, there was an error, described by the String.
