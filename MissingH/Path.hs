{- | Splits a pathname into a tuple representing the root of the name and

{- | Make an absolute, normalized version of a path with all double slashes,
dot, and dotdot entries removed.

The first parameter is the base for the absolut calculation; in many cases,
it would correspond to the current working directory.

The second parameter is the pathname to transform.  If it is already absolute,
the first parameter is ignored.

Nothing may be returned if there's an error; for instance, too many @..@ entries
for the given path.
