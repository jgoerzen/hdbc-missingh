   Module     : MissingH.IO.Binary
   Copyright  : Copyright (C) 2004-2005 John Goerzen
   License    : GNU GPL, version 2 or above

   Maintainer : John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org> 
   Stability  : provisional
   Portability: portable to platforms supporting binary I\/O

This module provides various helpful utilities for dealing with binary
input and output.

Important note: /binary functions are not supported in all Haskell
implementations/.  Do not import or use this module unless you know you
are using an implementation that supports them.  At this time, here
is the support status:

 * GHC 6.2: yes
 
 * GHC 6.x, earlier versions: unknown

 * GHC 5.x: no

 * nhc98: no

 * Hugs: partial (maybe complete; needs more testing)

Non-binary functions may be found in "MissingH.IO".

{- | As a wrapper around the standard function 'System.IO.hPutBuf',
this function takes a standard Haskell 'String' instead of the far less
convenient 'Ptr a'.  The entire contents of the string will be written
as a binary buffer using 'hPutBuf'.  The length of the output will be
the length of the string. -}

this function returns a standard Haskell string instead of modifying
a 'Ptr a' buffer.  The length is the maximum length to read and the
semantice are the same as with 'hGetBuf'; namely, the empty string
is returned with EOF is reached, and any given read may read fewer
bytes than the given length. -}

yourself.
