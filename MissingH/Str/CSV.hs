{- | Parse a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file.  The return value is a list of
lines; each line is a list of cells; and each cell is a String.

Please note that CSV files may have a different number of cells on each line.
Also, it is impossible to distinguish a CSV line that has a call with no data
from a CSV line that has no cells.

Here are some examples:

>Input (literal strings)          Parses As (Haskell String syntax)
>-------------------------------- ---------------------------------
>1,2,3                            [["1", "2", "3"]]
>
>l1                               [["l1"], ["l2"]]
>l2
>
> (empty line)                    [[""]]
>
>NQ,"Quoted"                      [["NQ", "Quoted"]]
>
>NQ,"Embedded""Quote"             [["NQ", "Embedded\"Quote"]]

To parse a String, you might use:

>import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec
>import MissingH.Str.CSV
>....
>parse csvFile "" mystring

To parse a file, you might instead use:

>do result <- parseFromFile csvFile "/path/to/file"

Please note that the result of parsing will be of type
(Either ParseError [[String]]).  A Left result indicates an error.
For more details, see the Parsec information.
