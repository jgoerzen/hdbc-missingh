{- | Main class for readable mailboxes. 

The mailbox object /a/ represents zero or more 'Message's.  Each message
has a unique identifier /b/ in a format specific to each given mailbox.
This identifier may or may not be persistent.

Functions which return a list are encouraged -- but not guaranteed -- to
do so lazily.

Implementing classes must provide, at minimum, 'getAll'.
