{- | Transmits an e-mail message using the system's mail transport agent.

This function takes a message, a list of recipients, and an optional sender,
and transmits it using the system's MTA, sendmail.

If @sendmail@ is on the @PATH@, it will be used; otherwise, a list of system
default locations will be searched.

A failure will be logged, since this function uses 'MissingH.Cmd.safeSystem'
internally.

This function will first try @sendmail@.  If it does not exist, an error is
logged under @MissingH.Cmd.pOpen3@ and various default @sendmail@ locations
are tried.  If that still fails, an error is logged and an exception raised.
