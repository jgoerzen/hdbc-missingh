INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are several methods:

1. Using Cabal -- recommended, especially for ghc users

2. Using hmake -- not yet supported

3. Manual

--------------------------
Cabal
--------------------------

First, install the Cabal distribution for your favorite compiler.
Get it from http://www.haskell.org/cabal.  Debian users can
apt-get install libghc6-cabal-dev.  Then run "make setup" (you may
need to edit the Makefile if you don't use GHC).

Then:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install

-------------------------
Manual
-------------------------

Edit the Makefile to support your compiler.  The Makefile will
require GNU make.  Type "make" or "gmake".  Copy the library and .hs or .hi
files to the appropriate locations.  That may be all that you need to do.
