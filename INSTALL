PREREQUISITES
-------------

You must satisfy one or more of these major categories:

1. GHC 6.4 or above (including cpphs)

2. GHC 6.2.x (including cpphs) plus Cabal 0.5 or above

3. Hugs 2005xx or above, plus cpphs

4. Hugs 2003xx partially supported, plus cpphs

If you don't already have cpphs, get it from
http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/.

If you need Cabal, get it from http://www.haskell.org/cabal.

Debian users can install the packages cpphs and libghc6-cabal-dev.

Now, for GHC:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install

Or, for Hugs:

 ./setup configure --hugs
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
 
Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test-ghc6

or:

 make test-hugs
